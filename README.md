# Hello, World! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here's a little about me:

## About Me

During my psychology studies, my interest in software led me to start learning programming. It's been four years since I began with Python, then moved on to PHP, where I developed various applications. I have also developed my skills in MySQL, Tailwind CSS, and Vue.js along with these two programming languages. Over the past year, I've been busy working on modules with the Laravel framework. I'm eager to use my diverse skills and love for learning to contribute to collaborative projects and make a difference in the software development field.
